What is HTTP?

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

Two HTTP Request Methods: GET and POST

Two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are: GET and POST.

    GET - Requests data from a specified resource
    POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

The GET Method

Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request:
/test/demo_form.asp?name1=value1&name2=value2

Some other notes on GET requests:

    GET requests can be cached
    GET requests remain in the browser history
    GET requests can be bookmarked
    GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
    GET requests have length restrictions
    GET requests should be used only to retrieve data

The POST Method

Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the HTTP message body of a POST request:
POST /test/demo_form.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2

Some other notes on POST requests:

    POST requests are never cached
    POST requests do not remain in the browser history
    POST requests cannot be bookmarked
    POST requests have no restrictions on data length

Other HTTP Request Methods

The following table lists some other HTTP request methods:
Method 	Description
HEAD 	Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body
PUT 	Uploads a representation of the specified URI
DELETE 	Deletes the specified resource
OPTIONS 	Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports
CONNECT 	Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel
